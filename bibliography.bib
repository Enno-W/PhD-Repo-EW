@article{Gilchrist2018,    abstract = {Grit is an adaptive trait that predicts achievement outcomes in various contexts. However, little is known about the factors that predict grit in achievement domains such as sport and exercise. Using the broaden-and-build theory as the guiding framework, we sought to test a model whereby feelings of pride predicted grit across two separate samples. Undergraduate athletes (N = 109) and recreational long-distance runners (N = 116) completed questionnaires at a single time-point. In study 1, state pride was positively associated with grit (r = 0.26, p =.003). No gender differences were observed. In study 2, both global and fitness-related pride were assessed to determine their association with grit. Inverse associations between global pride and grit were noted for authentic (β = 0.33, p <.001) and hubristic (β = −0.26, p =.003) pride. Only fitness-related authentic (β = 0.42, p =.003), but not hubristic (β = 27, p =.053), pride was a significant predictor of grit. Findings provide initial insight into pride and grit in sport and exercise contexts. Partial support for the broaden-and-build theory was found. Specifically, experiences of pride are associated with grit, but only when success is attributed to one's own effort. Attributing success to innate ability or superiority may result in reduced persistence and interest toward goal attainment. Given these findings, it may be important to create opportunities to experience authentic pride to develop grit.},    author = {Gilchrist, Jenna D. and Fong, Angela J. and Herbison, Jordan D. and Sabiston, Catherine M.},    doi = {10.1016/J.PSYCHSPORT.2017.12.009},    issn = {1469-0292},    journal = {Psychology of Sport and Exercise},    keywords = {Broaden-and-build theory,Exercise,Gender,Positive emotions,Sport},    month = {5},    pages = {1-7},    publisher = {Elsevier},    title = {Feelings of pride are associated with grit in student-athletes and recreational runners},    volume = {36},    year = {2018}, }

	abstract = {Purpose Awe is an essential post-experience assessment; nevertheless, few studies have discussed its role in the field of outdoor sports or outdoor sports tourism. In this study, the authors aim to examine the effects of awe on participants' satisfaction and behavioral intention by considering the perceived vastness of the natural environment, perceived professionalism, and self-image congruity as drivers. Design/methodology/approach The authors proposed and empirically tested a research model based on a survey with 480 responses collected in China. The effect of awe is explored from the perspectives of both sufficiency logic and necessity logic by applying the combined use of partial least squares structural equation modeling ({PLS}-{SEM}) and necessary condition analysis ({NCA}). Findings The results show that the perceived vastness of the natural environment, perceived professionalism and self-image congruity are sufficient conditions for awe: these factors affect awe positively, which, in turn, positively affect satisfaction and behavioral intention. Furthermore, both the perceived vastness of the natural environment and perceived professionalism represent a necessary condition for awe. Awe acts as a necessary and sufficient condition for both participants' satisfaction and behavioral intention. Practical implications The results of this study suggest that the generation of awe can be used as a business strategy to influence outdoor sports participants' choices in practice. In addition to the unique natural environment, professional exercising and self-realization are key success factors in enhancing the positive evaluations of outdoor sports participants. Originality/value This study is a first attempt to identify the role of awe in outdoor sports activities. Methodologically, it provides a paradigm for the combined use of {PLS}-{SEM} and {NCA} in sports management research by identifying the necessary and sufficient effects of awe on outdoor sports participants' post-experience evaluation.},

Several subjective components of awe have been identified, including feelings of connectedness and self-diminishment, making it a form of self-transcendent experience. Awe has also been linked to increased well-being and altruistic behavior.
