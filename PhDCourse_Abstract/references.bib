  author    = "DeYoung, Colin G and Tiberius, Valerie",
  abstract  = "Value Fulfillment Theory (VFT) is a philosophical theory of
               well-being. Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T) is a psychological
               theory of personality. Both start with a conception of the
               person as a goal-seeking (or value-pursuing) organism, and both
               take goals and the psychological integration of goals to be key
               to well-being. By joining VFT and CB5T, we produce a cybernetic
               value fulfillment theory in which we argue that well-being is
               best conceived as the fulfillment of psychologically integrated
               values. Well-being is the effective pursuit of a set of
               nonconflicting values that are emotionally, motivationally, and
               cognitively suitable to the person. The primary difference in
               our theory from other psychological theories of well-being is
               that it does not provide a list of intrinsic goods, instead
               emphasizing that each person may have their own list of
               intrinsic goods. We discuss the implications of our theory for
               measuring, researching, and improving well-being.",

               well-being",
  author    = "Fredrickson, Barbara L and Joiner, Thomas",
  abstract  = "The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions predicts that
               positive emotions broaden the scopes of attention and cognition,
               and, by consequence, initiate upward spirals toward increasing
               emotional well-being. The present study assessed this prediction
               by testing whether positive affect and broad-minded coping
               reciprocally and prospectively predict one another. One hundred
               thirty-eight college students completed self-report measures of
               affect and coping at two assessment periods 5 weeks apart. As
               hypothesized, regression analyses showed that initial positive
               affect, but not negative affect, predicted improved broad-minded
               coping, and initial broad-minded coping predicted increased
               positive affect, but not reductions in negative affect. Further
               mediational analyses showed that positive affect and
               broad-minded coping serially enhanced one another. These
               findings provide prospective evidence to support the prediction
               that positive emotions initiate upward spirals toward enhanced
               emotional wellbeing. Implications for clinical practice and

  abstract  = "Among both exercisers and athletes, affect provides feedback
               about progress toward goals and feelings of authentic pride can
               serve as a barometer of achievement. Low levels of authentic
               pride may signal that changes in effort or behavior are needed.
               Prior work has focused on stable individual differences in pride
               rather than fluctuations in pride as people pursue their goals.
               The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that
               achievement is associated with authentic pride and that
               fluctuations in authentic pride predict changes in training
               behaviors as evidenced by fluctuations in subsequent training
               progress.This study used a longitudinal design with repeated
               weekly online diaries and multilevel modelling to test study
               objectives.Participants training for a long-distance race (N =
               131, 78\% women; M = 35.4 years) provided weekly self-reports on
               pride and training progress for seven weeks.Multilevel models
               indicated that training progress predicted authentic pride at
               both the within- (b = 0.43, p < .001) and between-person level
               (b = 0.53, p < .001). When participants reported lower authentic
               pride than usual on a given week, training progress increased
               the following week (b = âˆ’0.31, p < .001). Conversely, greater
               authentic pride was associated with greater training progress on
               average (b = 0.21, p < .001).Consistent with control-process
               accounts, runners may use their feelings of pride to regulate
               their behavior. Low feelings of pride can be adaptive for goal
               striving by signaling when strategies or efforts need to be
               adjusted.",

  abstract  = "People who express positive emotion usually have better social
               outcomes than people who do not, and suppressing the expression
               of emotions can have interpersonal costs. Nevertheless, social
               convention suggests that there are situations in which people
               should suppress the expression of positive emotions, such as
               when trying to appear humble in victory. The present research
               tested whether there are interpersonal costs to expressing
               positive emotions when winning. In Experiment 1, inexpressive
               winners were evaluated more positively and rated as lower in
               hubristic-but not authentic-pride compared with expressive
               winners. Experiment 2 confirmed that inexpressive winners were
               perceived as using expressive suppression to downregulate their
               positive emotion expression. Experiment 3 replicated the
               findings of Experiment 1, and also found that people were more
               interested in forming a friendship with inexpressive winners
               than expressive winners. The effects were mediated by the
               perception that the inexpressive winner tried to protect the
               loser's feelings. This research is the first to identify social
               costs of expressing positive emotion, and highlights the

               association between fitness-related pride and
               moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). A secondary aim
               was to examine behavioural regulations consistent with
               organismic integration theory (OIT) as potential mechanisms of
               the pride-MVPA relationship. DESIGN: This study used a
               cross-sectional design. METHODS: Young adults (N = 465; Mage =
               20.55; SDage = 1.75 years) completed self-report instruments of
               fitness-related pride, motivation and MVPA. RESULTS: Both
               authentic and hubristic fitness-related pride demonstrated a
               moderate positive relationship with MVPA, as well as positive
               associations to more autonomous regulations. Behavioural
               regulations mediated the relationship between both facets of
               pride and MVPA with specific indirect effects noted for
               identified regulation and intrinsic motivation. CONCLUSION:
               Overall, these findings demonstrate the association between
               experiencing fitness-related pride and increased engagement in
               MVPA. The tenability of OIT was also demonstrated for offering

  abstract  = "Beliefs about emotions can influence how people regulate their

               differences in how people regulate their emotions after
               experiencing a negative event. We hypothesized that, because of
               dialectical beliefs about negative emotions prevalent in Eastern
               culture, Easterners are less motivated than Westerners to engage
               in hedonic emotion regulation-up-regulation of positive emotions
               and down-regulation of negative emotions. By assessing online
               reactions to a recent negative event, Study 1 found that
               European Americans are more motivated to engage in hedonic
               emotion regulation. Furthermore, consistent with the reported
               motivation to regulate emotion hedonically, European Americans
               show a steeper decline in negative emotions 1 day later than do
               Asians. By examining retrospective memory of reactions to a past
               negative event, Study 2 further showed that cultural differences
               in hedonic emotion regulation are mediated by cultural
               differences in dialectical beliefs about motivational and
               cognitive utility of negative emotions, but not by personal
               deservingness or self-efficacy beliefs. These findings
